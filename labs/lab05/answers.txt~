NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of people who  have  been  added  to
  Friendbook.

===============
  FbUnfriend
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(log(n))

- Explanation: The function calls MapGet which calls doGet which has a time complexity of log(n).
                The rest of the functions are at constant time. Therefore the time complexity of FbUnfriend is log(n).

===============
FbMutualFriends
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)

- Explanation: ListAppend uses realloc O(n) at worst case, ListAppend is inside a for loop which at worst case makes it O(n^2). Other parts of the function are at constant time.

===============
 FbFriendRecs1
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2 * log(n))

- Explanation: nameToId is O(log(n))

               Insdie the for loop
               
               FbMutualFriends is O(n^2)
