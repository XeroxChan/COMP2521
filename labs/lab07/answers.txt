NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: We visit each cell at most once and during the queue operations,at most 4 cells would be added to the queue each time, so the loop at the worst case would have 4*n iterations. Therefore the worst case time complexity of it would be O(n);

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: Similar to the reason to solveBfs but 4 cells are added to the stack instead of the queue.
